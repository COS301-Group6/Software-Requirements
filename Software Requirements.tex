  \paragraph*{This document is formulated using LaTeX and UML class diagrams. Its purpose is to illustrate to the client the requirements of the project and reach an agreement between developers and client for the scope of the project. This document states clearly what the developed solution must be able to do and what function the solution cannot do. This document is regarded as an official contract between developers and client when the pre and post conditions stated are met. Due to the nature of software development processes, this document may still be finalised.}
  \section{Vision}
  % 3
  \paragraph*{The aim of this project is to provide a mobile web-based marking IT solution to the client, Mr Jan Kroeze at the University of Pretoria, that allows users to upload student marks to a mark sheet and also be able to use these marks at a later stage. The solution is aimed to be easy to use and more efficient than the pen-and-paper marking system.}

  \subsection{Access channel requirements}
  \paragraph*{Lecturers, tutors and students will access this system's services through a Mobile Android application. They will also be able to use this system's services through a web browser interface. A lecturer will be able to manage the marks and will be able to extract mark lists as csv files.}

  \subsection{Quality requirements}
\begin{description}
  \item[Auditability:] \hfill  \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: High, Requirement: NFRQ1) \\
  Everything that happens on the system must be saved in a log and must be able to be queried. Especially alterations to marks will be logged. Any updates made as well as additions added will be logged. \\
  \item[Flexibility:] \hfill \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: Medium, Requirement: NFRQ2) \\
  The application will work on Mobile phones with an Android operating system. The web interface will be able to be viewed from a mobile device or from a personal computer.\\
  \item[Reliability:] \hfill \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: High, Requirement: NFRQ3) \\
  The application will always be on line and will be usable as long as users are connected to the internet, same applies to the web interface. If the user loses internet connection the system will make a local backup on the device being used and will commit this data to the system as soon as it gets internet connection again.\\
  \item[Scalability:] \hfill \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: High, Requirement: NFRQ4) \\
  The system needs to react quickly on input or commands. Performance and reliability should not be dependent on the amount of users on the system.\\
  \item[Security:] \hfill \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: High, Requirement: NFRQ5) \\
  Users will have to log in with their specific user name and password to access the system. Only valid users, with valid authentication and presence on the system may gain access to the system. Lecturers will be able to change closing times of mark sheets, change marks and view reports. Tutors will be able to input student marks which he/she is assigned to. Students will only be able to view their own marks.  \\
  \item[Usability:] \hfill \\
  (Source: Jan Kroeze, Priority: High, Requirement: NFRQ6) \\
  It must be a simple, easy to use system.

  \subsection{Introduction}
  \paragraph*{Any registered user should be able to log in and out of the system using a unique username and password. After a user has loged in, he is redirected to his home page.}
  \paragraph*{A student must be able to view their marks on the application as well as on  the web interface. The student can then view each module's marks separately via links to each module. }
  \paragraph*{A marker, has additional links to the modules he marks. When a marker click on these links, the active marksheet of the module is displayed. The marker can then click on the marksheet to open the mark sheet and enter marks. When the marker open the mark sheet he has to enter the students initials, surname, full name, student number or username. The system has to use autocomplete search for this function. The marker then may view, delete add or modify the marks. Afterwards he has to save and clode the mark sheet.}
  \paragraph*{On a lecturer's home page, a list of all his old mark sheets is displayed. On the home page, he may either create a new mark sheet, or view an old mark sheet. An old mark sheet can be viewed by searching or by selecting one out of the list.}
  \paragraph*{To create a new marksheet, the lecturer of a module must have a [New Mark Sheet] button. For each new marksheet, the lecturer should be able to enter a description, question amount with a maximum amount of marks per question, a rubric, marker's privileges, expiry date and release date. The marking privileges refer to who may enter or change marks, the default should be the lecturer only. The expiry date refer to whan the marksheet is locked, meaning no more marks may be entered. The release date refer to when the student may view their marks, the default is the expiry date. After all the details are filled in, there should be a form of confirmation like a [confirm] button.}
  \paragraph*{When viewing a mark sheet, the lecturer may choose to unlock the marksheet. The lecturer may then modify the marks on the sheet. The lecturer must save the mark sheet and lock it. }
  \paragraph*{When viewing a mark sheet, the lecturer may export the mark sheet in either csv or pdf file. he may also choose to delete the mark sheet}
  \paragraph*{The lecturer should be able to view statistics of a mark sheet.  This report must be exportable as a pdf. This includes the percentages that passed and has extinctions, as well as the average and standard deviation. The report also include a distribution graph, pie chart and bar graph.}
  \paragraph*{The system must be able to calculate compositional marks.}
